### SQL_EDA_Project

Introduction:

As a data analyst tasked with exploring and analyzing the "layoffs_staging2" dataset, this project involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL. The dataset comprises several key fields including company name, location, industry, total number of employees laid off, percentage of employees laid off, date of the layoffs, stage of the layoffs, country, and funds raised by the company in millions.

The primary objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and factors surrounding layoffs within various companies across different industries and locations. By leveraging SQL queries, we aim to uncover key metrics such as the frequency and magnitude of layoffs, distribution of layoffs across industries and countries, temporal trends in layoff occurrences, and potential correlations between layoffs and factors such as funding raised by companies.

Through comprehensive SQL EDA, we seek to provide valuable insights and actionable recommendations to stakeholders, enabling them better to understand layoffs' dynamics within the dataset's context and make informed decisions regarding workforce management, investment strategies, and industry trends.
